I am Kedong Xiu, a first-year Ph.D student at Zhejiang University, fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. Tianhang Zheng and Prof. Kui Ren.

My research focuses on the intersection of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)**, and **Cybersecurity**, aiming to build trustworthy and robust AI systems.

Currently, I am interested in the following topics:

* Jailbreaking
* Alignment
* Inversion Attack
* Agent Security

My earlier research focused on  **Password Security** , a topic I may revisit in the future as part of my broader interests. ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž
